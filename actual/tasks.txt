Hi, and welcome to SWAPbook! Created by Harvard sophomores Sara Valente, CS concentrator in Quincy House, 
ELizabeth Healey, Bioengineering concentrator in Cabot House, and Liam Baughman, Applied Math concentrator
also in Cabot House, Swapbook is a web-based application that coordinates textbooks resales among Harvard 
students. For those wishing to sell old textbooks, Swapbook enables users to post textbooks for sale, 
and for those wishing to purchase textbooks cheaply, Swapbook empowers users to browse listed options 
and to contect sellers to arrange sales. Let's see how this works. 

Starting from the intro page, users register and login to see their personalized home page, which 
includes a newsfeed of all the most recent sales listed on the site. In "Sell", users can describe 
the textbook they wish to sell and post it for the Swapbook community to see. Next, in "Mylistings," users
can monitor and change the listing status of all the textbooks they've ever listed. But "Buy" includes the 
most powerful functionality, allowing users to search for textbooks by class and then send messages 
to other users whose textbook listing they are interested in. Through the "Inbox" messaging system, 
buyers and sellers can coordinate the exchange entirely within Swapbook. 

Alltogether, these pieces make Swapbook a useful and efficient way for textbook resales at Harvard.
